This document explains how to use the PhyloGeoTool software. PhyloGeoTool is a web application that is installed at a web server, and can be accessed via a web browser. Most users will access a publically (or privately) accessible instance of the PhyloGeoTool that was already deployed on a web server. An example of a publically available instance of the PhyloGeoTool that represents a large HIV cohort (i.e. EuResist \cite{Zazzi2012}) can be found at \url{http://regatools.med.kuleuven.be/phylogeotool/PhyloGeoTool}.\\
It is however also possible to install your own instance of the PhyloGeoTool, for this, we refer to the installation manual \footnote{(TODO: add link)}.

\section{Getting started}

PhyloGeoTool implements a visual method to explore large phylogenetic trees and to depict characteristics of strains and clades, including their geographic context, in an interactive way.
The tool also provides the possibility to insert new virus strains into the existing phylogenetic tree, allowing users to gain insight in the placement of such new strains without the need to reconstruct the phylogeny. \\

A particular PhyloGeoTool instance can be used by navigating the browser to the URL at which this instance has been deployed. For example, the aforementioned public EuResist instance of the PhyloGeoTool is deployed at \url{http://regatools.med.kuleuven.be/phylogeotool/PhyloGeoTool}, and thus, you should navigate your browser to this exact URL.\\
\footnote{
TODO: explaining what instances are all about, is easier if you can mention more than 1 instance. Perhaps Lize will have a HCV/DENV instance ready soon, that we can add here, but maybe we should both deploy the EuResist and PT tool, such that we can list them in this section.}\\
Note that any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer) should do, if you experience any problems with your browser, please contact us (\footnote{TODO: link to the contact section}).


\section{Core functionality and user interface}
%TODO: update all images when the software is ready
%TODO: all images are 400x400px, why not use a percentage, and let the images be their natural dimenions?
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=400pt, height=400pt, keepaspectratio=true]{images/initial_view.PNG}
\caption{Start and main view of the PhyloGeoTool. The panel on the upper left shows a map that depics the geographical distribution of the sequences of the relevant phylogeny, the lower left panel shows a bar chart that depicts the value distribution for one of the sequence attributes, and the right panel shows a top-level view of the clustering of the tree, as determined by our clustering algorithm \footnote{(TODO: add reference to our paper)}.}
\label{fig:initial_view}
\end{figure}

The tool is divided into different panels: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The top left panel shows a map where each country is colored according to a gradient, where a darker color signifies that more sequences are originating from this country. A drop down box allows you to select the geographic region on which you want to focus (e.g. Europe, North-America, \ldots).
  \item The bottom left panel shows a bar chart which shows a certain attribute (i.e. characteristic) from all sequences currently visualized in the tree-panel on the right. A drop down box allows you to select the attribute to be plotted on the bar chart. The attributes available for selection depend on the attributes made available by the PhyloGeoTool instance.
  \item The right panel initially shows the root of the clustered phylogenetic tree. A button allows you to visualise the phylogenetic tree in its entirety, colored according to the shown clusters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hover over a cluster node}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=400pt, height=400pt, keepaspectratio=true]{images/hover_node.PNG}
\caption{Hovering over a node in the cluster phylogeny}
\label{fig:hover_node}
\end{figure}

When a node in the cluster phylogeny is hovered, both the attribute bar chart and the map are updated. The attribute bar chart will be extended (i.e. extra bars will be shown for each value) with the data that is located in the hovered cluster. The map, on the other hand, will only show the geographic distribution of the sequences found in the hovered cluster.
\\
When you click on a node in the clustered phylogenetic tree, you will navigate to the clustering of this particular node (i.e. you will zoom in on the node on the clustered phylogenetic tree).
A counter on the bottom left of the cluster panel keeps track of the depth of your navigation. As you can visit a cluster node by clicking it, you can go back to into your navigational path by using the browser 'Back' button.
\\
Additionally, the URL encodes the level of descent in the clustered phylogenetic tree. An URL can thus be bookmarked or shared to go back at the exact location in the clustered phylogenetic tree.\\ 

\subsection{Select a geographic region}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=400pt, height=400pt, keepaspectratio=true]{images/change_country.PNG}
\caption{Change the region in the drop down box}
\label{fig:change_region}
\end{figure}
You can select your geographical region of interest in the drop down box on top of the map (see fig. \ref{fig:change_region}). 

\subsection{Select a sequence attribute}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=400pt, height=400pt, keepaspectratio=true]{images/change_attr.PNG}
\caption{Change the attribute in the drop down box}
\label{fig:change_attr}
\end{figure}
You can select an attribute of interest in the drop down box on top of the attribute bar chart (see fig. \ref{fig:change_attr}).

\subsection{Visualize the phylogenetic tree}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=400pt, height=400pt, keepaspectratio=true]{images/view_tree.PNG}
\caption{Visualizating the phylogenetic tree, colored according to the clustering scheme}
\label{fig:view_tree}
\end{figure}

When the 'View Tree' button (located on top of the clustered phylogeny panel) is clicked, a popup window is shown (fig. \ref{fig:view_tree}) \footnote{(Update figure with current view)}that visualizes the phylogeny as a radial phylogenetic tree. The colours in the radial tree correspond to the colours of the clusters in the panel showing the clustered phylogenetic tree.
\\
From this window, the tree can be exported into various formats (PDF, SVG, NEXUS and PNG) by clicking on the 'Export' button. Note that exports in the NEXUS file format can be visualized in programs such as FigTree \footnote{(TODO: add link to figtree)}.  

\subsection{Automated phylogenetic placement of your sequences}
Phylogenetic placement enables the placement of unknown query sequences onto an existing phylogenetic tree, without the need to re-compute the entire phylogeny (which is a time-consuming process, especially when a large number of sequences is involved). In PhyloGeoTool, we use phylogenetic placement to position new sequences onto the cluster phylogeny, in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. minutes). We implement this placement using the well-known pplacer software package \cite{Matsen2010} \footnote{(TODO: should we mention the type of score we use? likelihood-based/posterior-based?)}.\\
To place your sequences on the cluster phylogeny, click the 'Phylo-place' button in the clustering window. A window \footnote{(TODO: add ref to figure)} will popup that enables you to place your sequences. There are two ways to add a new sequence to the tree:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paste your sequence in the 'Nucleotide sequence' field
\item Upload a FASTA file containing the nucleotide sequence using the file chooser.
\end{itemize}
Currently, we only support the submission of 1 sequence at a time.

\section{Example: exploring a large HIV-1 dataset}

As mentioned earler, we host a publically available instance of the PhyloGeoTool that used all HIV-1 data that is available within the EuResist Integrated Data Base \cite{Zazzi2012}. 
This database contains virus genotypes, clinical responses and epidemiological markers of more than 66.000 patients from 12 different countries.
We made a YouTube video available where all features we discussed earlier are demonstrated using the EuResist PhyloGeoTool instance: \footnote{(TODO: add video)}. \\

Video scenario:\\
 as in this video (that we created earlier, for a presentation I gave in June) -> \url{https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0JA80u3ZPTbVVTNThrVXVRam8} \\
 with these additions/changes :\\  
 - we should talk during the video \\
 - we should do an export in NEXUS format and open this in FigTree \\
 - when phylo-placing, go down to the level where the placement was done\\
 - when phylo-placing, I don't think it is necessary to show the upload, simply pasting the sequence in the field is OK \\
