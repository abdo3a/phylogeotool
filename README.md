PhyloGeoTool is a web-application to interactively navigate large phylogenies and to explore associated clinical and epidemiological data. PhyloGeoTool implements an algorithm that automatically partitions a phylogeny into an optimal number of clusters, thereby recursively partitioning each identified cluster. A graphical user interface provides a concise visualisation of the different levels of the phylogenetic tree and the attributes (geographical, clinical, demographical) associated with the sequences.

PhyloGeoTool has been built to be user-friendly in use, only requiring a phylogenetic tree and a text file describing the attributes of the sequences. An user instruction manual (TODO make a link out of this) is available to provide on information the use of the application. For users who whant to host their own instance of the tool, an installation manual (TODO make a link out of this) is available.  

The methodology paper describing PhyloGeoTool has been submitted for peer-review. A citation to cite PhyloGeoTool will be provided as soon as the paper has become publicly available.

The first release of the source code is available (TODO make a link out of this).
