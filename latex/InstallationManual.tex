\section{Installation}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

\subsubsection*{Java}
Download and install the newest Java Development Kit (JDK) from \url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}.
The current version of PhyloGeoTool was built on JDK 1.8.0\_31.

\subsubsection*{Tomcat}
Download and install the latest Tomcat version from \url{http://tomcat.apache.org}.

\subsubsection*{Github}
Download the code from \url{https://github.com/rega-cev/phylogeotool/}. 
The project is currently still private. 
During the trial period you can send an email to \href{mailto:phylogeotool@kuleuven.be}  {phylogeotool@kuleuven.be} with your Github account name to get read rights on the project.

\subsubsection*{Ant}
Download and install the newest Ant version from \url{http://ant.apache.org/} as we will use it to build our project.
The current version of PhyloGeoTool was built with Ant 1.9.4

\subsection{Building the project}

\subsubsection{Linux}

We here outline the various steps necessary for a successful build of the project.
The build process here is described as it was performed on an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) installation.
\begin{itemize}
\item Go the the following directory:
\item \ldots
\end{itemize}

\section{Data preparation}
After the project has been built successfully, different jar files can be found in the dist folder. 
Their function is explained in the sections below.

\subsection{DistanceMatrix.jar}
Tool to create a distance matrix based on the phylogenetic tree that will be used in the PhyloGeoTool.
\\
DistanceMatrix.jar takes the following input values:
\begin{itemize}
\item phylo.tree: Link to the phylogenetic tree to be used in the PhyloGeoTool.
\item distance matrix: Link to the location where the distance matrix can be written.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PreRender.jar}
Before any data can be shown to the user, a lot of calculations are done backend. To speed up the process, most of those calculations can be done beforehand.
\\
PreRender.jar is a multithreaded application meaning that it performs best on any Java version > 7. Lower Java versions do not support our implementation of multithreading and will thus fail.
\\
PreRender.jar takes the input files:
\begin{itemize}
\item phylo.tree: Link to the phylogenetic tree used in the PhyloGeoTool.
\item csvFile: Link to the csv file that connects nodes in the tool to attributes. Note: The id in the csv file has to be the same as the id of the nodes in the tree.
\item distance matrix: Link to the distance matrix that was generated from this tree.
\item folder xml tree: Link to the folder where this jar can write its resulting tree files.
\item folder xml clusters: Link to the folder where this jar can write its resulting cluster files.
\item folder xml csv: Link to the folder where this jar can write its resulting csv files.
\item folder figtree: Link to the folder where this jar can write its resulting figtree representations.
\end{itemize}
